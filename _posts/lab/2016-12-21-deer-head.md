As an admirer of the striking aesthetic of mounted deer heads but a strong opponent of the unnecessary harm to animals, I embarked on a creative journey to design a cruelty-free alternative. This led me to conceive and create a 'flatpackable' laser-cut deer head.

Below are images documenting the development process and the final product. For an in-depth view, check out the embedded PDF portfolio at the end of this post.

### Designing in AutoDesk Inventor Professional

The construction of the deer head began in AutoDesk Inventor Professional. Here's a glimpse into the initial rendering stage, both with and without textures:

### Adding Textures

To add a natural feel, I rendered the deer head with a wood texture:

### From Digital to Physical: The Laser Cutting Process

The 2D CAD drawings were then transferred to a Laser Cutter, resulting in these final products:
