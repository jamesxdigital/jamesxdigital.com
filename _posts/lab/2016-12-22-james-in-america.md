In 2013, my family and I embarked on an unforgettable journey, traversing the vast landscapes of the United States from coast to coast. To document our experiences and share them with the world, I created a blog using [Anchor](https://anchorcms.com){:target="\_blank"}, an intuitive content management system (CMS). This digital diary was diligently updated nearly every day throughout our two-month adventure.

One of the highlights of our trip was during our stay in Iowa, as detailed in [this blog post](../jamesinamerica/blog/heart-of-america.html){:target="\_blank"}. An unexpected opportunity arose when my sister and I were invited for a live interview on Channel 13 News at the Iowa State Fair at 6 PM. I seized the moment to promote our blog on air. Following this, the blog received an overwhelming response, with hundreds of views per day and numerous engaging comments from viewers.

This road trip wasn't just a travel experience; it was a chance to connect with diverse communities across the country, bringing our stories to people's homes through the blog. The blog turned into more than just a personal memoir; it became a bridge linking us with many who followed our journey online, echoing our experiences and adventures.
