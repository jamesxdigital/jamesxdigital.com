I was tasked by Leeds Sky UK to develop a new app concept for their Sky Broadband customers. The brief was clear: create an app that provides customers with a visual representation of their home network setup. This app aims to help users understand the connection between their hub, the speed to their connected devices, usage, and signal strength.

## Video Demonstration

To give a more dynamic overview of the app's functionality and user experience, here is a video demonstration:
