F1 is the second most popular sport in the Sky digital portfolio and over the next 6 years, Sky has unparalleled access to Formula 1 content and data. With new technology and innovation being at the forefront of the sport, this project aims to transform how fans watch Formula 1, with the Sky Sports smartphone app at the core. Whether you’re a fanatic or newbie to Formula 1, the purpose of this project is to define what’s possible in digital experiences through sport.

For this project, I designed a Sky x Red Bull Formula 1 app. The video demonstration below tells you everything you need to know!
