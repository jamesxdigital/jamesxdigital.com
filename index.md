Hey 👋, I'm James. I’m a Creative Technologist and explorer.

🧑‍💻 I’m into experimenting with disruptive digital innovation, creativity with tech, and travelling.

💡 Currently, you can find me thinking, talking and working on the hardware, software and design of Spatial Computing (Augmented and Mixed Reality) and AI experiences.

🌍 I was raised in the UK, but have lived in Austria and now Amsterdam.

💼 I’ve worked at big brands like Red Bull, as well as in mid-sized design and tech agencies.

🎓 Prior to that, I completed a BSc in Computer Science and an MA in Digital and Interactive Design.
