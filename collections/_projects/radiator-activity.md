Is the online hub for the videos and scrapbooks that my girlfriend Katie and I have created over the years. It showcases our travels, adventures, and everyday lives, featuring annual anniversary videos, trip highlights, and curated scrapbooks. 

The video below is our 2024 annual anniversary video. Visit [RadiatorActivity.com](https://radiatoractivity.com) for all the content.
