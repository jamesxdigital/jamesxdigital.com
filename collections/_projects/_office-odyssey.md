Office Odyssey reimagines the typical desk exercise bike by turning it into a dynamic experience where you can cycle through virtual environments. Designed with the idea of blending work and wellness, this project allows users to participate in charity miles or compete with colleagues—all while sitting at a desk.

The experience was taken further by allowing users to “travel” through cities like New Delhi or London by simply pedalling. Additionally, we experimented with AI filters, where users could change the environment to something unique, like cycling through an underwater city. Office Odyssey combines fitness, VR, and creativity, providing an innovative way to make exercise an integrated part of the workday.
