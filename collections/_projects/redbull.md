## Introduction
From 2018 to 2022, I relocated to Salzburg, Austria, to work at the headquarters of Red Bull Media House. During this period, I had the opportunity to contribute to both the Platforms team and the Media and Content Innovation team. My role focused on enhancing the [RedBull.com](https://redbull.com){:target="_blank"} portfolio and experimenting with cutting-edge technologies to produce 'beyond the ordinary' content that aligns with Red Bull's dynamic brand image.

## Innovating the RedBull.com Portfolio
Within the Platforms team, my primary responsibility was to innovate and optimize the [RedBull.com](https://redbull.com){:target="_blank"} website. This involved:
- **User Experience Enhancements:** Streamlining navigation and improving the overall user interface to increase engagement and retention.
- **Feature Development:** Implementing new functionalities that support Red Bull's diverse content offerings, including event coverage, athlete profiles, and multimedia content.
- **Scalability Solutions:** Ensuring the platform could handle high traffic volumes during major events and product launches without compromising performance.

## Media and Content Innovation
In the Media and Content Innovation team, I focused on pushing the boundaries of traditional content creation by integrating new technologies. Key initiatives included:
- **Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR):** Developing immersive experiences that allow users to engage with Red Bull content in novel ways.
- **Interactive Media Solutions:** Creating interactive videos and live streams that enhance viewer participation and brand interaction.
- **Advanced Content Capture Techniques:** Utilizing drones, 360-degree cameras, and other innovative tools to produce high-quality, captivating content.
