In this collaborative project within Triple Innovation, we developed Hey Steve—a custom GPT model that responds as if it were Steve Jobs in the year 2000.

We sourced a second-hand Mac G3, a vintage Apple computer from the early 2000s, and trained a GPT model to replicate Steve Jobs’s tone and thought process from that era. Using voice cloning technology from Eleven Labs, we gave Hey Steve the ability to speak in Jobs’s voice.
