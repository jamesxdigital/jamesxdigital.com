The Patent Machine is a collaborative project made within Triple Innovation. It is an interactive installation that humorously explores the concept of AI-generated intellectual property.

With just three words entered on a phone, the Patent Machine generates technical drawings, 3D models, and even AR/VR experiences of the inventions it imagines. Users can take home physical printouts of their AI-generated patents or view them in immersive mixed or augmented reality.
