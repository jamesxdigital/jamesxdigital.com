Muscle Memory is a collaborative project developed at Triple Innovation to explore the concept of learning new skills through repetitive motor movement guided by advanced body tracking and AI technology. The project initially focused on improving form in racket sports, such as perfecting serves or backhand returns, but its applications quickly expanded to include other disciplines like dance. By leveraging cutting-edge body tracking and motion analysis, Muscle Memory demonstrates how AI can accelerate skill acquisition in a variety of fields.

    <h4>Dance Training with Real-Time Feedback</h4>
    <p>
      This video showcases how users can upload a video of a dance move, such as a robot routine, and learn it through real-time motion tracking. The app compares the user’s movements with the professional’s and provides a QR code to download a personalized video with music.
