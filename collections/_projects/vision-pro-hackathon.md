This project was part of a 48-hour hackathon where three teams from Triple worked in a remote farm Airbnb in the Netherlands, experimenting with the Vision Pro to explore new possibilities. The challenge was to create an app related to food or baking with a focus on innovation.

The resulting app concept revolved around the memory palace technique, where users could position and anchor ingredients virtually around their room. For example, when selecting a chocolate cake recipe, virtual representations of ingredients like flour, sugar, and cocoa powder could be placed in specific spots within the room, creating a spatially anchored, interactive experience. This method aimed to make recipes memorable and engaging by seamlessly blending the real and virtual worlds.

To further enhance the experience, the app incorporated 3D scanning technology. Using an iPhone, users could scan actual ingredients or the final dish, replacing placeholder visuals with realistic 3D models. This workflow allowed for a more immersive and personalized cooking experience, showcasing the potential of the Vision Pro to revolutionize how we approach everyday tasks like cooking and recipe management.
