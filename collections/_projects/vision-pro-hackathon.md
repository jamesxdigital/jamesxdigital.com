This project was part of a three-day hackathon where three teams from Triple worked in a remote location with the Vision Pro to explore new possibilities. The challenge was to create something related to food or baking with a few specific rules in place. One of the winning teams took inspiration from the concept of a “memory palace,” a method used to improve memory by associating information with spatial locations.

The team created an experience where users could anchor ingredients for recipes in different parts of their physical space, like placing virtual flour or sugar on a kitchen counter or refrigerator. The goal was to make recipes unforgettable by blending them into the real-world environment, offering an alternative to traditional cookbooks. This project showcased the Vision Pro’s potential to revolutionize learning and memory techniques in everyday settings.
