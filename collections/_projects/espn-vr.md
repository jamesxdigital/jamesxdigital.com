In April 2023, I developed a mixed reality experience in collaboration with ESPN Netherlands, KPN, and TiledMedia. Using Unity, we live-streamed a PSV vs. AZ football match directly to VR headsets. This event offered viewers a 360Â° virtual skybox experience, creating the sensation of being physically present at the stadium while watching from the comfort of their homes.

The event was hosted as a one-day showcase where 60 headsets were provided for attendees to experience the match in real-time. This project not only highlighted the potential of immersive technology in sports broadcasting but also demonstrated the technical challenges and achievements of live VR streaming on a large scale.

The project was promoted extensively, including this banner from ESPN's official website:

This project showcased how VR can bridge the gap between live sports and at-home viewing, offering fans an immersive and interactive way to experience their favorite matches. It was an incredible opportunity to combine cutting-edge technology with live sports entertainment.
