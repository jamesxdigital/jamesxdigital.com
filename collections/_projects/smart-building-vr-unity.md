## Introduction
The University of Sheffield's Diamond building exemplifies modern architecture and technology, offering a unique opportunity to explore smart building management through Virtual Reality (VR). In this project, I integrated the Diamond's extensive sensor network with a dynamic VR experience using Unity, aiming to create a more intuitive way to interact with building data.

## The Challenge
Equipped with over three thousand sensors, the Diamond building continuously monitors parameters such as temperature, humidity, and CO‚ÇÇ levels. Managing and interpreting this extensive data set was a significant challenge. My objective was to move beyond conventional data analysis by utilizing the building's detailed CAD model to develop a VR environment in Unity that effectively visualizes this data.

## The Solution

By combining a gaming engine with architectural data, I created a VR system that allows users to navigate the Diamond's environmental performance visually. This system provides real-time data insights and tracks changes over time, offering a comprehensive view of the building's operational dynamics.

## Recognition and Impact
### CIBSE Technical Symposium 2019
My work was recognized at the CIBSE Technical Symposium 2019 at the University of Sheffield. During the symposium, I presented my findings and was honored with the award for the 'Most Significant Contribution to Building Services'. For a more detailed overview of the project, please refer to my [published paper 1 (long)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/368707324_Visually_Displaying_Past_and_Present_Smart_Building_Data_Through_Virtual_Reality){:target="_blank"} [published paper 2 (short)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331651264_Visually_Displaying_Past_and_Present_Smart_Building_Data_Through_Virtual_Reality){:target="_blank"}

## Expansion to ARUP Design
Building on the project's success at Sheffield, I collaborated with ARUP Design to further develop the VR Smart Building platform. This enhanced system not only monitors the Diamond's internal environment but also integrates external data such as weather and wind conditions, providing a more holistic view of the building's performance.

## Conclusion
Integrating VR with smart building data offers a promising approach to understanding and managing complex building environments. This project has demonstrated how VR can make building data more accessible and actionable, contributing to more effective building management practices. I encourage you to explore the details of this project through my paper and consider the potential applications of VR in your own smart building initiatives. Thank you for your interest, and I welcome any feedback or discussions!
